Darth putin, the dark lord of the sith was on his way to the strip club in his newly bought spaceship. 
When suddenly an astroid hit his spaceship in the tail, putin lost controll over his ship and crashed into the atmosphere.
As the ship hit the atmosphere it started to burn, putin had to act quickly or he would surely parish.


Putin wakes up in the cockpit after being unconsious after being hit by the astroid.
He sees that his ship is heading towards Corusant in full speed, he needs to slow down his spaceship.
infront of him there are two levers, the right one is the brake and the one to the left is the thruster

-Putin Pulls the break lever and the ships speed decreases and he has more time to save the ship.
-Putin pulls the thruster lever and nothing happens it appears as the thruster is broken and the ship is still crashing down towards Corusant in the same speed as before.

Darth Putin walks out of the cockpit and enters the engine room. There is a dead body there, Putin does not know why. When putin opens the door to the engine room he is met by a raging fire.
He needs to act fast before the engine explodes from the heat of the fire. 
Putin can either use force lightning, get the fire extinguisher or spit on it.

-putin uses force lightning, its super effective the fire retreats into space and the engine room is safe.
-putin tries to get the fire extinguisher but soon realise he didn't buy one.
-Putin spits on the fire it doesnt help at all but he feels a little bit better, at least he tried.

He looks at the escape pod and wonders if he should abandon the ship and save his own skin or if he should keep trying to save the ship.

-Putin escapes into safety in his pod. He forgot that his ship was crashing towards the strip club.
